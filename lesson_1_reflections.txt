1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Ans:- When we view difference between two versions of a file, we can compare the lines to see where have we made changes and what could have probably gone wrong.
We could see what changes are occuring due to which change in the lines by changing the code one at a time and again comparing the codes.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Ans:- Having a history of a file can make one more efficient in the following ways:-
	-One can check their progress.
	-One can revert the changes if they caused a bug(in case of a code file).
	-One always has backup if anything goes wrong.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Ans:- 
Pros of manually saving changes
	1. We choose when to save changes and have control
	2. Memory is not wasted saving small changes
Cons of maunally saving changes
	1. We might miss important points where we should have commited

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
